## Intro

This is a project about a user's favorite places around the U.S. We've been building it out over the last few sprints:
* In Project 4, we built the layout and made it so that the user is able to edit their profile name and title through the use of Javascript!
* In Project 5, we added even more interactive features and functionality to the Location cards.
* In Project 6, we learned how to validate forms and implement more event handling, such as keyboard events.
* Now, in Project 7, we're applying what we learned about object-oriented programming and modular Javascript to refactor our code from previous projects.

## Project description

For Project 7, we were directed to create Javascript classes and reorganize/refactor our previous code.
We applied some of our recent lessons from Sprint 8 of the Practicum by Yandex: Web Developer program, including:
* Using the 'this' property
* Private and public methods and properties
* Javascript classes
* Modular Javascript
* Importing and exporting modules

Project 7 specifically focused on adding new features to our "Around the U.S." page, such as:
* Refactoring to create and incorporate a Card class
* Refactoring to create and incorporate a FormValidator class

## Requirements
We haven't learned how to connect our sites to servers yet, so bear in mind the profile information submitted won't be saved after you refresh the page.

## Plans for improvement
Once we learn more about JavaScript, we may add even more interactive features, such as changing out the user's profile photo, saving input to servers, and more.
