## Intro

This is a project about a user's favorite places around the U.S. In Project 4, we built the layout and made it so that the user is able to edit their profile name and title through the use of Javascript! Now, in Project 5, we've added even more interactive features and functionality to the Location cards.

## Project description

For Project 5, we were provided a **[Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/avLHzpJw2dmU2NaDATZ6CX/Sprint-5%3A-Around-The-U.S.-%2F-desktop-%2B-mobile?node-id=0%3A1)** as our creative brief.
We applied some of our recent lessons from Sprint 6 of the Practicum by Yandex: Web Developer program, including:
* Working more with arrays and functions
* Manipulating DOM with templates

Project 5 specifically focused on adding new features to our "Around the U.S." page, such as:
* Initializing Location card data from Javascript instead of HTML
* Creating a form to add new Location cards
* Developing the functionality of adding new Location cards, as well as removing/deleting existing ones
* Toggling the state of a "Like" button for each Location cards
* Adding another new modal element: a picture lightbox/popup that enlargens the Location card's image
* Creating smooth transitions with an element's visibility property

## Requirements
We haven't learned how to connect our sites to servers yet, so bear in mind the profile information submitted won't be saved after you refresh the page.

## Plans for improvement
Once we learn more about Javascript, we may add even more interactive features, such as changing out the user's profile photo, validating field inputs, and more.
