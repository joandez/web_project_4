## Intro

This is a project about a user's favorite places around the U.S. We've made it so that the user is able to edit their profile name and title through the use of Javascript!

## Project description

For this project, we were provided a **[Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/mUgu8OSHWE0M6p6vfwmdu9/Sprint-4-Around-The-U.S.-desktop-mobile?node-id=0%3A1)** as our creative brief. We were instructed to build a responsive page that reacts to user actions in order to apply topics covered in Sprint 5 of the Practicum by Yandex: Web Developer program, including but not limited to:
* An introduction to Javascript
* DOM (Document Object Model)
* Working with attributes, CSS classes, and events

## Requirements
We haven't learned how to connect our sites to servers yet, so bear in mind the profile information submitted won't be saved after you refresh the page.

## Plans for improvement
Once we learn more about Javascript, we can add even more interactive features, such as changing out the user's profile photo, adding new location cards, etc.
