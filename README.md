## Intro

This is a project about a user's favorite places around the U.S. We've been building it out over the last few sprints:
* In Project 4, we built the layout and made it so that the user is able to edit their profile name and title through the use of Javascript!
* In Project 5, we added even more interactive features and functionality to the Location cards.
* Now, in Project 6, we're learning how to validate forms and implement more event handling, such as keyboard events.

## Project description

For Project 6, we were provided a **[Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/KUbYgXnYElfzxCbcrlsOCE/Sprint-6%3A-Around-The-U.S.?node-id=0%3A1)** as our creative brief.
We applied some of our recent lessons from Sprint 7 of the Practicum by Yandex: Web Developer program, including:
* Event handling
* Event bubbling and delegation
* HTML form properties
* JavaScript form validation

Project 6 specifically focused on adding new features to our "Around the U.S." page, such as:
* Validating the "Edit Profile" form with minimum and maximum characters
* Validating the "New Location" form with input field types
* Closing modal elements when clicking on its overlay or pressing the Esc key

## Requirements
We haven't learned how to connect our sites to servers yet, so bear in mind the profile information submitted won't be saved after you refresh the page.

## Plans for improvement
Once we learn more about JavaScript, we may add even more interactive features, such as changing out the user's profile photo, saving input to servers, and more.
